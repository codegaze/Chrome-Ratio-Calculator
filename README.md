## Introduction

I created this extention to easy calculate a 16:9 ratio for images while I code HTML pages, but it can calculate any ratio you want.

## Installation 

This extention isn't in the Chrome Web Store so you need to enable the Developer mode in ```chrome://extensions/```. Then click ```Load unpacked extentions``` and load the extentions' folder.

## Usage

Just click on the extention button in your browser and play with the numbers.
